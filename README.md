## Status

Production ready.

Check [code coverage by the testsuite](https://app.codecov.io/gh/dolmen-go/sqlfunc).

### Known issues

* There is a speed/memory penalty in using the `sqlfunc` wrappers
  (check `go test -bench B -benchmem github.com/dolmen-go/sqlfunc`).
  It is recommended to do your own benchmarks. There are plans to fix
  that (add a code generator to reduce cost of runtime `reflect`),
  but no release date planned for this complex feature.
